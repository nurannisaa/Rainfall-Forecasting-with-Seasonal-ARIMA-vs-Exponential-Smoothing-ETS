# Rainfall Forecasting : Seasonal ARIMA vs Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

## Project Introduction
A forecast is a calculation or prediction of some future event or condition. Forecasting will be helpful as a guide before taking action in some condition in the future. In Indonesia, as a country that is quite dependent on agriculture, prediction of future rainfall will be very helpful in the pre-planning water resources. Especially as we know unexpected amount of rainfall due to climate change can affect agricultural productivity. But to prevent that, we can decide when is the best time to start planting and maximizing the harvest from the prediction of future rainfall. 

In this project, we will try the forecasting using Python language and the forecast model that will be used are Seasonal ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing (ETS). Then from the two models used in the analysis, we will choose which model that has the best performance on the forecasting. The purpose of the analysis is to determine the range of the amount of rain that will occur and see the rainfall trends in the next few years, such as whether there will be an increase or decrease in extreme rainfall or a seasonal shift because of the effects of climate change that currently happening.
